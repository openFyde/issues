# openFyde Issues - Centralised Issue Collector ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to the centralised issue tracking repository for all openFyde-related projects.

## Why This Repository Exists

The openFyde organisation contains approximately **60 individual repositories**, and GitHub's flat organisational structure doesn't support hierarchical folders or sub-folders. This creates several challenges:

- **Discovery Problem**: Finding the correct repository to submit an issue can be overwhelming for users
- **Fragmentation**: Related issues are scattered across dozens of repositories
- **Search Difficulty**: Searching for existing solutions requires checking multiple repositories individually
- **Missed Context**: Issues in specialised repos might lack visibility from the broader community

This centralised issue repository solves these problems by providing:
- âœ… A single entry point for all openFyde-related issues
- âœ… Unified search across all project issues
- âœ… Better visibility for common problems and solutions
- âœ… Streamlined triage and routing to appropriate maintainers

## Guidelines for Creating Effective Issues

A well-crafted issue helps everyone - it gets you faster assistance and helps us improve openFyde more effectively. Here's how to create issues that matter:

### 1. **Be Respectful and Constructive**
- Remember there are real people on the other side working hard on this project
- Avoid demanding language; we're all here to help each other
- If frustrated, take a break before writing your issue

### 2. **Search First, Ask Second**
- Check existing issues (both open and closed) for similar problems
- Review the documentation and FAQ before submitting
- Reference any related issues you find, even if they don't fully solve your problem

### 3. **Be Specific and Detailed**
- Use clear, descriptive titles (Bad: "Doesn't work" | Good: "WiFi fails to connect on RockPi 4B with WPA3 networks")
- Include exact error messages, not paraphrases
- Specify version numbers, build dates, and hardware revisions

### 4. **Provide Context and Reproducibility**
- Describe what you were trying to achieve
- List the exact steps to reproduce the issue
- Note if the issue is consistent or intermittent

### 5. **Share Your Attempts**
- Document what you've already tried
- Include any workarounds you've discovered
- Link to relevant forum discussions or documentation you've consulted

### 6. **Be Patient and Responsive**
- Allow time for maintainers to respond (we're often volunteers)
- Respond to follow-up questions promptly
- Update the issue if you find additional information or a solution
